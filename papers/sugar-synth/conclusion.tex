% In this paper,
We have presented a novel method for synthesizing production rules for glycans.
% \textsc{SugarSynth} is a CEGIS like iterative method.
We have applied our method to real-world data sets. % to illustrate that our method
% can find the rules in scenarios.
% The viability of the synthesized rules can only be verified by conducting wet experiments.
We are planning to work in biological labs to check the viability of the solutions
found by our method.
We are the {\em first} to apply formal methods for the synthesis problem.
% We have opened a new direction for the application of formal methods in biology.




% % Future extensions

% reviewer comment:
% In the future, authors may also consider allowing a set of enzymes as
% input and checking whether these can generate the observed glycans, or
% to allow users to specify additional rules that are known to play a role.

% A more thorough future evaluation on biological data could consist of
% running GLYSYNTH on glycans from samples where generating enzymes are
% known and checking if the rules uncovered are consistent with these
% enzymes (assuming rules can be linked to enzymes).
% This is correct, and we should indeed do this ASAP.

% However, there are limitations to our current method.
% Apart from the case of repeating treelets,
% our method currently only operates on finite sets and objects.
% For example, we do not look for counterexample molecules for arbitrary heights.
% The design of the method has a flavor of bounded model-checking.
% A couple of parameters of the method impose the limit. 
% We are working to develop a method that is independent of the limitation.

% % Input data
% We do not support a full end to end interpretation of the data from the wet experiments.
% We assumed that we know the precise set of molecules as input.
% However, the wet biological experiments that identify glycans in a cell do not directly
% produce the set of molecules.
% The information about the glycans is limited.
% The experiments provide only the molecular weights of the glycans.
% Furthermore, they may selectively break bonds of glycans and read the weights of the
% parts.
% Using the information and computational methods, biologists estimate the likely
% set of observed glycans.
% The methods are not deterministic and may not report all possible combinations
% of molecules that may satisfy the given data.
% % The usual experimental errors may also cause failure to detect molecules.
% Much of human intuition guides the data interpretation.
% In our work, we have ignored the aspect of
% the interpretation step.
% In the future, we will try to bring this part of data analysis
% into our toolchain. 

% We are also considering to support a few more variants of the synthesis problem.
% For example, the boundary between the compartments may not be strict.
% On the transition from a compartment to next,
% the production rules of the first may not be immediately disabled and
% are phased out slowly, while the rules of the next compartment are already applicable.
% This momentary interleaving of the rules may explain the production of certain molecules.

% We may also consider the other stay models where a molecule may stay
% a limited amount of time and the number of operations on the molecules is
% bounded.
% In the model of stay, we may need to work out if we should bound the number
% of operations per branch or for the whole molecule.
% These kinds of modeling will require incorporation of time and probability in the method.

% We are also working to validate our synthesized production rules using wet experiments.
% We will be aiming for a cell that produces a large number of glycans and
% does not immediately lend itself to a human guess for the production rules.
% We will be developing experiments that will allow us to test the production rules
% that are output of our tool.

% On the theoretical side, the synthesis problem can be potentially
% modeled as minimization of a modified version of tree automaton~\cite{minTree},
% where the next move of the automaton additionally depends on the ancestors
% and siblings of a letter in a tree word.
% This modeling may allow us to apply many out of the box theoretical results
% for our synthesis problem.
% For example, we may view the rule synthesis problem as an automaton minimization problem, i.e.,
% finding the minimum set of transitions of the automaton such that the given set of
% words are accepted.
% The variation from the standard tree automaton has signification consequences such that
% the known efficient methods for the minimization are not applicable.
% Please note that we have applied an SMT solver on the problem.
% However, as far as we know, the synthesis problem is not known to be NP-complete. There may be more efficient methods.

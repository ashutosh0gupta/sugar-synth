-       How generic is the templating mechanism? //done
-       How many iterations may be necessary in the worst case (or even in the experiments for that matter?) //done
-       How large is the search space? // done
-       Why is it sufficient to exclude a single solution in each step? //done
-       Will this algorithm always terminate? //done
-       viability / relevance of the synthesized solutions?// done

Related work: Kappa calculus framework, citations on applications of formal methods to biological structures,
some work done in theoretical chemistry might be relevant (e.g., the work of Christoph Flamm from University of Vienna)
============
Minor issues
============
pp2. "encoding that are there other molecules"... I am not able to get this sentence.
pp5. Fig. 2 too small to see the details
pp6. Fig 3 better organisation/typesetting would help, e.g., tikz
pp7.  the formal part following the definition 1 should be more structured to become readable
pp7. do not use text directly typeset in math mode ($\mathit{...}$ or similar solution would help
pp8. the extended \cup symbol should be explained
pp9. typesetting of the algorithm should be improved to easily see what is the output/requirements
pp11. "creates the above constraints and store them..." -> ... _stores_ them
pp11. definitions mixed with algorithms seems strange I think you should define all the formal stuff first and then present the algorithms
pp12. ENOCDE -> ENCODE
pp16. "If we did not budget large enough parameters..." -> what kind of parameters?
pp16. "tool runs for a long time, which is typical" -> why?
general -- the latex tricks narrowing the space between figures and the text should be definitely avoided!

Review 3
there are no attempts to connect the results to any sort of non-biological setting.
As a result, the work sounds like an application of formal methods to biology
and would more likely find a better home in a computational biology meeting such as CSBio.
